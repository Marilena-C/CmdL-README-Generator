## Description
This is a command-line application that dinamically generates a README file based on the user input via command line, using the Inquirer package. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. 

## Installation
Users need to have access to a command-line  interface like VS Code or Git Bash. Install node.js and npm inquirer. You can open your folder in Terminal, Run **npm i** to  install all the list of your dependencies for this project.

## Usage
To run the application, in the editor (VS Code), right-click on the folder that contains the index.js file, select 'Open in Integrated Terminal' and then in Terminal run "node index.js". Answer the questions prompted and when all questions are answered, the md file is generated. Open the new README-file.md file created in the current working directory. Then righ-click on the README-file.md file and Open in preview to see how it looks like.
